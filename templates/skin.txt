Skin Disease Detection

Description: This process will depict the end-to-end process of building a flask API that accepts skin image as an input and detects the skin disease followed by sending medical report to patient and doctor through WhatsApp message.

Input:
EDA and Model Training
Whatsapp Configuration
Creating Flask API
EDA and Model Training
The dataset used for the training model is Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000

Exploratory Data Analysis
Frequency of Classes
Distribution of Skin disease over Gender
Histogram of the age of patients
Location of disease over Gender


**Note: ** There are 7 categories of skin disease and they are highly imbalanced. To resolve this issue, random oversampling is applied before model training along with pixel standardization.

Oversampling increases data size by 4 times. validation and test accuracy exceed 90% after balancing class frequency.

Major Steps Involved:

1. Whatsapp Configuration
2. Creating Flask API

Twilio library is used to send a medical report through Whatsapp. Token and account ID is stored in a separate file named credentials.py

essentials.py contains two major functionalities which are used in developing API.

stringTORGB is to convert base64 string to image. Skin image is sent as base64 string through API call which is converted to image through stringTORGB.

get_model method contains architecture of trained model.

API contains methods to encode the image to base64 string and also detect skin disease and send to Whatsapp message.


Output:

If the confidence of model output is not greater than 80% then it is declared as 'No disease' class. Individual Whatsapp message is sent to patient and doctor regarding disease class.
